#Next.js Web Scraper with Cron Job

This is a Next.js web scraper application that uses a cron job to update the prices of products scraped from Amazon.

Note
To see this web scraper in action, it's recommended to run it locally on your machine. The deploy site API is heavy, and Vercel's free plan may lead to unexpected behavior due to resource limitations.

Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the scraper

#NOTE
You can view the updated product prices on the application's user interface, accessible at http://localhost:3000.
##Deployment
This application can be deployed to a hosting platform of your choice, but be aware that it can be resource-intensive. Consider using a paid hosting plan or server with adequate resources for smoother performance.
